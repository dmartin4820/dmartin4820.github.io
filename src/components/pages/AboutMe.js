    	    Junior software developer with interest in working on finding solutions to a variety of software problems, easy or challenging. Recently obtained a Physics M.S. at Stanford where I performed two years of data analysis, automation of instrumentation, and experimentation in Python and LabView. My interests are in solving hard and novel problems, specifically with programming. Currently, Iâ€™m hoping to apply my problem-solving skills to software/web development. In two recent projects (Jam Map and Event Architect), I worked with four different people, two on each project, and we built simple web apps using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MySQL. During these two projects, I enjoyed tackling problems in JavaScript, Node.js, and models for the MVC paradigm of the second project.
